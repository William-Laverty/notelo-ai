# Notelo Application Wireframes

This directory contains wireframes for the Notelo AI-powered document summarization application. These wireframes illustrate the user interface design and layout for key pages of the application.

## Overview

Notelo is an AI document summarization platform that enables users to convert various types of content (PDFs, URLs, text, YouTube videos) into concise, readable summaries. The application also offers additional learning features like quizzes, flashcards, and audio versions of summaries.

## Design Principles

These wireframes follow several key design principles:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity** - Clean interfaces that prioritize content and functionality
2. **Consistent Navigation** - Common elements like headers and navigation are consistent across pages
3. **Visual Hierarchy** - Important elements are emphasized through size, position, and visual weight
4. **Responsive Design** - Layouts adapt appropriately for different screen sizes
5. **Actionable Metrics** - Statistics that demonstrate value and encourage continued usage

## User Flows

The wireframes support these primary user flows:

1. **Discovery & Signup**
   - Landing Page → Sign Up → Onboarding → Dashboard

2. **Content Processing**
   - Dashboard → Upload Content → Processing → Content Viewer

3. **Learning**
   - Content Viewer → Summary → Quiz → Flashcards → Podcast

4. **Account Management**
   - Dashboard → Account Settings → Update Profile/Password/Subscription

## Implementation Notes

These wireframes are intended as a visual guide for the implementation of the user interface. Actual implementation should:

1. Use the technologies specified in the project (React, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS)
2. Follow accessibility best practices
3. Implement responsive behavior for all screen sizes
4. Maintain consistent styling with the established design system
5. Consider performance implications, especially for mobile devices

## Next Steps

After reviewing these wireframes, the next steps would be:

1. Create high-fidelity mockups with specific styling details
2. Develop interactive prototypes to test user flows
3. Implement the designs in React components
4. Test the implementation for usability and accessibility
